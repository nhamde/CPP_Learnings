### Auto and Decltype

### Problem Statement: How can the readability of the code be increased using new features of C++?

### auto keyword is used for deriving the type of the variable or object from the value being assigned to the variable or object. 
### Image 1 shows the type of line is automatically derived from the data being assigned to the variable.

### decltype is used to declare the type of an object with the help of another known object. This deduces type of object during compile time.
